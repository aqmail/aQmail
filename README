s/qmail -- fast, secure, and reliable email transmission

WHAT IT IS:
- s/qmail is a fork of qmail (1.03) including the 
  features of the Spamcontrol patch together with
  IPv6 capabilities and AMD64 enabled
- s/qmail is API- and plug-in-compatible with qmail,
  thus add-ons like vpopmail, ezmlm, and vmailmgr
  and many others work without changes 
- s/qmail uses the concept of D.J. Bernstein's
  coding without compromise 

INCULDING:
The following (DJB) packages are included:
- checkpassword (as qmail-authuser)
- fastforward
- qmailanalog 
- qmail-mrtg

REQUIREMENTS:
- ucspi-ssl (> 0.9.x) -- won't run without it
- ucspi-tcp6 (generating the cdb)
- daemontools package (supervising the services)

HOW TO INSTALL:
- s/qmail uses D.J.B's slashpackage convention 
  for installing while trying to conserve the
  standard qmail installations:
  * untar the sqmail tar file under '/package'
  * Move to /package/mail/sqmail/sqmail-V.R.F
  and go on with installation
- Set up the s/qmail package with the
  following step-by-step options or simple run:
  * package/install -- does it all

HOW TO INSTALL ON OpenBSD:
- s/qmail should be placed under
  /usr/local/qmail
  -- or --
- mount -u -o suid /var 

Step-by-step:

  * package/dir -- sets up the directories
  * package/ids -- sets up the s/qmail users
  * package/ucspissl -- hooks up the required
    sources and libs with package ucspi-ssl
  * package/compile [X] -- compiles the sources
  * package/upgrade [X] -- potentially does the upgrade
  * package/legacy -- installs the binary in the 
    qmail directory
  * package/man -- installes the man pages
  * package/control -- populates the mininmal 
    required control files for running
  * package/sslenv -- sets up the SSL/TLS 
    environments together with X.509 certs
    and key files (from ucspi-ssl)
  * package/service -- sets up the run
    script for daemontools' /service and
    additionally the logging 
  * package/scripts [X]
    setup up optional, undocumented
    and unmaintained scripts.
  * package/run -- touches qmail/alias/ files
    and sets default-delivery.

- Simply run package/install !

CUSTOMIZATION OF S/QMAIL:
Basic: 
- Define hardware architecture (i386/AMD64) in 
  * conf-ld (default is AMD64)

Advanced:
- Customize user-ids and pathes according to
  conf-XXX the package main directory.
  * conf-break -- usually the character '-' for VERP addresses
  * conf-cc -- compiler (no change required)
  * conf-delivery -- qmail-start default-delivery
  * conf-djbdns -- DJBDNS libs (not supported yet)
  * conf-groups*) -- s/qmail groups
  * conf-home -- home dir of s/qmail [/var/qmail] 
  * conf-ids*) -- Unix ids for s/qmail
  * conf-instances -- QMQ instances 
  * conf-ld -- loader options to be adjusted (for i386)
  * conf-log -- target dir of s/qmail logs [/var/log]
  * conf-man -- target dir of man pages
  * conf-patrn -- s/qmail paternalism [002]
  * conf-qmq -- QMQ settings 
  * conf-spawn -- silent concurrency limit [120]
  * conf-split -- depth of s/qmail dirs [23]
  * conf-svcdir -- supervise's 'service' directory
  * conf-ucspissl -- path to UCSPI-SSL dirs
  * conf-users*) -- user names

*) These files are coupled and need to be adjusted
   as one entity!

UPGRADE FROM QMAIL:
Basic:
- s/qmail will keep your current qmail setup 
  (except for the binaries)
  * Make sure, to have ucspi-ssl installed
  * Extract s/qmail under /package
  * cd /package/mail/sqmail-V.R.F
  * package/ucspissl
  * package/compile
  * package/legacy
  * package/man
  * package/upgrade
Advanced:
- In case your qmail installation is out of default,
  use the conf-* settings (ie. ids)
Port separator:
- You need to change the port separator in the
  control files from ':' to ';' - if applicable.
CAUTION:
- Please make sure, that your qmail 'todo' queue
  and the 'tcpto' table is empty (qmail-tcpto, 
  qmail-tcpok)
