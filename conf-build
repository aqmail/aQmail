# guarantees that single-byte writes are atomic and that directory operations are
# synchronous.  These guarantees are provided by fixed-block filesystems  such as
# UFS and by journaling filesystems.  Under Linux, make sure that all filesystems
# which do mail-handling are mounted with synchronous metadata.

# *qmail users and groups
#
# The qmail system is heavily partitioned for security; it does almost nothing as
# root. The users are the alias user, the daemon user, the log user, the owner of
# miscellaneous files  such  as binaries,  the passwd user,  the queue user,  the
# remote user, and the send user. The values (names) can be changed.

# These are the qmail groups.  The process group (GRPP) should not have access to
# any files, but it must be usable for processes;  this requirement  excludes the
# 'nogroup' and 'nobody' groups on many systems.  The other group is the standard
# group.

# You can override this choice at run time with the qmail-users mechanism. Multi-
# character delimiters are not permitted.
