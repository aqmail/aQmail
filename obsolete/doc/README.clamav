Patch to ClamAV 0.8x/0.9x
=========================

There is a bug in ClamAV 0.9x not 
to write scanning results to STDERR.
Instead all logging is done to STDOUT.

This inhibits the logging for qmail-smtpd.

The intended behavior of ClamAV can be 
re-established applying the patch

  clamav-0.90.1_output.patch_

to 

   output.c 

in ClamAV's source directory

   ./shared.
