qlibs - C library and headers based on 'djblib' and libowfat.

Initially these libs were excluded from *qmail and forseen to use with eQmail. As
the packages of djb (D.J. Bernstein) uses these libs in different versions, there
comes up the need to have a consistent state. As time was going on there was also
a need to include additional functionality and up-to-date best practices. Short -
this was the point where some parts from libowfat were included.

In theorie - these libs can be used with any djb software.

Usage

There are 2  files to configure qlibs:
  - conf-qlibs: configure compiler flags
  - conf-inst:  configure installation options

See inside these files to get further information.

qlibs could be used local AND global. Here are a configuration example each:

Ex.1: local usage

  - copy the 'qlibs' folder into a subfolder of your package
  - edit conf-inst to your needs, e.g.
     LIBDIR=..
     HDRDIR=
  - add additional object files (*.o) to FILES (will be installed in $LIBDIR)

Ex. 2: global usage
  - extract (copy) 'qlibs' whereever you want
  - edit conf-inst, like, e.g.
      LIBDIR=/usr/local/lib
      HDRDIR=/usr/include/qlibs

for both examples:
  - add additional object files (*.o) to FILES (will be installed in $LIBDIR)
  - run './configure - make - make install'


CAVEATS:
- the man pages are simply taken from libowfat (in most cases)
- 'substdio' is still included for backwards compatibility of code
