qlibs - static C library and headers based on "djb's libs" and libowfat.

Initially these libs were excluded from *qmail and forseen to use with eQmail. As
the packages of djb (D.J. Bernstein) uses these libs in different versions, there
comes up the need to have a consistent state. As time was going on there was also
a need to include additional functionality and up-to-date best practices. Short -
this was the point where some parts from libowfat were included.

In theorie - these libs can be used with any djb software.

Usage:

Some build options  can be configured through 'conf-build'.  Read the comments in
this file for more information. qlibs could be used local or installed global. To
do so simply run

  $ make

which does all the steps of './configure  -  make  -  make install'. Don't forget
to make sure that libs and headers will be found by the compiler/linker.

CAVEATS:
  - the man pages are simply taken from libowfat (in most cases)
  - 'substdio' is still included for backwards compatibility of code (deprecated)
  - 'slurpclose.o' (deprecated, just for backwards compatibility) will be removed
    in the future
