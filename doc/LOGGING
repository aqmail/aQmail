Logging of SMTP Sessions
========================

Normally, qmail-smtpd doesn't log anything.

Within s/qmail, qmail-smtpd logs some accepted and some (important) rejected SMTP session attempts.

Format:	"qmail-smtpd: pid PID Action::Type::Condition: Information"

In order to track a complete SMTP transaction (including tcpserver/sslserver + rblsmtpd)
the log line includes now the PID.

Here's the glue:

  Accept SPF  Recipients_Cdb    ORIG was authorized and RCPT accepted as per recipients/cdb.
  Accept SPF  Recipients_Pam    ORIG was authorized and RCPT accepted as per recipients/pam plug-in.
  Accept SPF  Recipients_Wild   ORIG was authorized and RCPT was accepted as per recipients/wildlisting.
  Accept SPF  Rcpthosts_Rcptto 	ORIG was authorized and RCPT was accepted as per rcpthosts/morercpthosts

SNDR (S) corresponds to the sending MTA.
ORIG (F) is the "MAIL From: <Return-Path>".
RCPT (T) is the "RCPT To: <Forwarding-Path>".
DATA is the Message.

The Information is typically constructed from the SMTP envelope like:

  S:IP:FQDN P:Protocol H:Helo F:Mailfrom T:Rcptto


This scheme is easy extendable to other successful/deferred SMTP sessions.
